NOTE: these instructions are based on having the necessary python and javascript modules installed. 
The final submission was loaded on a Ubuntu VM. 


I. Configuration

Ports:

The msExchange must be receiving at 3000 and sending at 3001, as in the defaults in the project specification.


II. To Run

Run by calling script ./run.sh [name of test file] located in /CODE/client.

Go to localhost:8081 on your local browser and/or refresh.

Interact with the GUI.


III. Notes


The back end has been implemented for all the strategies and their average, and all the buys and sells are performed accordingly.
However, we ran out of time to output the data for the last three strategies so only the graph for the Simple Average is updated on the GUI.
Again, this does not affect transactions since the logic is implemented and working.
